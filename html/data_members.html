<h2 class='up'>ExifTool Object Data Members</h2>

<p>The following table lists the data members of the ExifTool object.  (If this
was C++, these would be documented next to the definitions in the header file,
but this is Perl, so I couldn't do that...)</p>

<p>Aside from the variables defined below, there may be other temporary
variables added by individual modules. Temporary variables are identified by at
least one lower case letter in their name, and are deleted automatically before
reading or writing each new image.  Make, Model and CameraType are temporary
variables like this, but these three are special because they are initialized to
an empty string instead of being deleted at the start of processing for each
image, which allows them to be tested without having to check for an undefined
value.</p>

<blockquote><table class='norm'><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>ADD_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory added during
    writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
    directory!)  To avoid adding a directory twice, entries may be
    deleted from this lookup, but only AFTER WriteDirectory() is called.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BASE</td><td>Absolute position of current image in containing file
    (for example, when processing JPEG image in FujiFilm RAF file)</td></tr>

<tr><td>BOTH</td><td>Reference to HASH of ValueConv/PrintConv arrays, saved for
    tags when GetValue is called for 'Both' values, and used to avoid having to
    recalculate both values again (which speeds up building the Composite tags
    because often the same tag is Require'd by multiple Composite tags).</td></tr>

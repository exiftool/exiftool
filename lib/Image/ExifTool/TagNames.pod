Image::ExifTool::TagNames - ExifTool tag name documentation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document contains a complete list of ExifTool tag names, organized into
tables based on information type.  Tag names are used to reference specific
meta information extracted from or written to a file.

=head1 TAG TABLES

The tables listed below give the names of all tags recognized by ExifTool.
They contain a total of 28465 tags, with 17681 unique tag names.

B<Tag ID>, B<Index#> or B<Sequence> is given in the first column of each
table.  A B<Tag ID> is the computer-readable equivalent of a tag name, and
is the identifier that is actually stored in the file.  B<Index#> refers to
the offset of a value when found at a fixed position within a data block
(B<#> is the multiplier for calculating a byte offset: B<1>, B<2>, B<4> or
B<8>).  These offsets may have a decimal part which is used only to
differentiate tags with values stored at the same position.  (Note that
writable tags within binary data blocks are not individually deletable,
and the usual alternative is to set them to a value of zero.)  B<Sequence>
gives the order of values for a serial data stream.

A B<Tag Name> is the handle by which the information is accessed in
ExifTool.  In some instances, more than one name may correspond to a single
tag ID.  In these cases, the actual name used depends on the context in
which the information is found.  Valid characters in a tag name are A-Z,
a-z, 0-9, hyphen (-) and underline (_).  Case is not significant.  A
question mark (C<?>) after a tag name indicates that the information is
either not understood, not verified, or not very useful -- these tags are
not extracted by ExifTool unless the Unknown (-u) option is enabled.  Be
aware that some tag names are different than the descriptions printed out by
default when extracting information with exiftool.  To see the tag names
instead of the descriptions, use C<exiftool -s>.

The B<Writable> column indicates whether the tag is writable by ExifTool.
Anything but a C<no> in this column means the tag is writable.  A C<yes>
indicates writable information that is either unformatted or written using
the existing format.  Other expressions give details about the format of the
stored value, and vary depending on the general type of information.  The
format name may be followed by a number in square brackets to indicate the
number of values written, or the number of characters in a fixed-length
string (including a null terminator which is added if required).

A plus sign (C<+>) after an entry in the B<Writable> column indicates a
I<List> tag which supports multiple values and allows individual values to
be added and deleted.  A slash (C</>) indicates a tag that ExifTool will
I<Avoid> when writing.  These will be edited but not created if another
same-named tag may be created instead.  To create these tags, the group
should be specified.  A tilde (C<~>) indicates a tag this is writable only
when the print conversion is disabled (by setting PrintConv to 0, using the
-n option, or suffixing the tag name with a C<#> character). An exclamation
point (C<!>) indicates a tag that is considered I<Unsafe> to write under
normal circumstances.  These tags are not written unless specified
explicitly (ie. not when wildcards or "all" are used), and care should be
taken when editing them manually since they may affect the way an image is
rendered.  An asterisk (C<*>) indicates a I<Protected> tag which is not
writable directly, but is written automatically by ExifTool (often when a
corresponding L<Composite|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/Composite Tags> or
L<Extra|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/Extra Tags> tag is written). A colon
(C<:>) indicates a I<Mandatory> tag which may be added automatically when
writing (use the API NoMandatory option to avoid creating mandatory EXIF
tags).  Normally MakerNotes tags may not be deleted individually, but a
caret (C<^>) indicates a I<Deletable> MakerNotes tag.

The HTML version of these tables also lists possible B<Values> for
discrete-valued tags, as well as B<Notes> for some tags.  The B<Values> are
listed with the computer-readable values on the left of the equals sign
(C<=>), and the human-readable values on the right.  The human-readable
values are used by default when reading and writing, but the
computer-readable values may be accessed by disabling the value conversion
with the -n option on the command line, by setting the PrintConv option to 0
in the API, or or on a per-tag basis by adding a hash (C<#>) after the tag
name.

B<Note>: If you are familiar with common meta-information tag names, you may
find that some ExifTool tag names are different than expected.  The usual
reason for this is to make the tag names more consistent across different
types of meta information.  To determine a tag name, either consult this
documentation or run C<exiftool -s> on a file containing the information in
question.

I<(This documentation is the result of decades of research, testing and
reverse engineering, and is the most complete metadata tag list available
anywhere on the internet.  It is provided not only for ExifTool users, but
more importantly as a public service to help augment the collective
knowledge, and is often used as a primary source of information in the
development of other metadata software.  Please help keep this documentation
as accurate and complete as possible, and feed any new discoveries back to
ExifTool.  A big thanks to everyone who has helped with this so far!)>

=head3 JPEG Adobe Tags

The APP14 "Adobe" segment stores image encoding information for DCT filters.
This segment may be copied or deleted as a block using the Extra "Adobe"
tag, but note that it is not deleted by default when deleting all metadata
because it may affect the appearance of the image.

=head2 EXIF Tags

EXIF stands for "Exchangeable Image File Format".  This type of information
is formatted according to the TIFF specification, and may be found in JPG,
TIFF, PNG, JP2, PGF, MIFF, HDP, PSP and XCF images, as well as many
TIFF-based RAW images, and even some AVI and MOV videos.

The EXIF meta information is organized into different Image File Directories
(IFD's) within an image.  The names of these IFD's correspond to the
ExifTool family 1 group names.  When writing EXIF information, the default
B<Group> listed below is used unless another group is specified.

Mandatory tags (indicated by a colon after the B<Writable> type) may be
added automatically with default values when creating a new IFD, and the IFD
is removed automatically when deleting tags if only default-valued mandatory
tags remain.

The table below lists all EXIF tags.  Also listed are TIFF, DNG, HDP and
other tags which are not part of the EXIF specification, but may co-exist
with EXIF tags in some images.  Tags which are part of the EXIF 3.0
specification have an underlined B<Tag Name> in the HTML version of this
documentation.  See
L<https://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/download_e.html?CIPA_DC-008-2024-E>
for the official EXIF 3.0 specification.

=head2 IPTC Tags

The tags listed below are part of the International Press Telecommunications
Council (IPTC) and the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) Information
Interchange Model (IIM).  This is an older meta information format, slowly
being phased out in favor of XMP -- the newer IPTCCore specification uses
XMP format.  IPTC information may be found in JPG, TIFF, PNG, MIFF, PS, PDF,
PSD, XCF and DNG images.

IPTC information is separated into different records, each of which has its
own set of tags.  See
L<http://www.iptc.org/std/IIM/4.1/specification/IIMV4.1.pdf> for the
official IPTC IIM specification.

This specification dictates a length for ASCII (C<string> or C<digits>) and
binary (C<undef>) values.  These lengths are given in square brackets after
the B<Writable> format name.  For tags where a range of lengths is allowed,
the minimum and maximum lengths are separated by a comma within the
brackets.  When writing, ExifTool issues a minor warning and truncates the
value if it is longer than allowed by the IPTC specification.  Minor errors
may be ignored with the IgnoreMinorErrors (-m) option, allowing longer
values to be written, but beware that values like this may cause problems
for some other IPTC readers. ExifTool will happily read IPTC values of any
length.

Separate IPTC date and time tags may be written with a combined date/time
value and ExifTool automagically takes the appropriate part of the date/time
string depending on whether a date or time tag is being written.  This is
very useful when copying date/time values to IPTC from other metadata
formats.

IPTC time values include a timezone offset.  If written with a value which
doesn't include a timezone then the current local timezone offset is used
(unless written with a combined date/time, in which case the local timezone
offset at the specified date/time is used, which may be different due to
changes in daylight savings time).

Note that it is not uncommon for IPTC to be found in non-standard locations
in JPEG and TIFF-based images.  When reading, the family 1 group name has a
number added for non-standard IPTC ("IPTC2", "IPTC3", etc), but when writing
only "IPTC" may be specified as the group.  To keep the IPTC consistent,
ExifTool updates tags in all existing IPTC locations, but will create a new
IPTC group only in the standard location.

=head2 XMP Tags

XMP stands for "Extensible Metadata Platform", an XML/RDF-based metadata
format which is being pushed by Adobe.  Information in this format can be
embedded in many different image file types including JPG, JP2, TIFF, GIF,
EPS, PDF, PSD, IND, INX, PNG, DJVU, SVG, PGF, MIFF, XCF, CRW, DNG and a
variety of proprietary TIFF-based RAW images, as well as MOV, AVI, ASF, WMV,
FLV, SWF and MP4 videos, and WMA and audio formats supporting ID3v2
information.

The XMP B<Tag ID>'s aren't listed because in most cases they are identical
to the B<Tag Name> (aside from differences in case).  Tags with different
ID's are mentioned in the B<Notes> column of the HTML version of this
document.

All XMP information is stored as character strings.  The B<Writable> column
specifies the information format:  C<string> is an unformatted string,
C<integer> is a string of digits (possibly beginning with a '+' or '-'),
C<real> is a floating point number, C<rational> is entered as a floating
point number but stored as two C<integer> strings separated by a '/'
character, C<date> is a date/time string entered in the format "YYYY:mm:dd
HH:MM:SS[.ss][+/-HH:MM]" but some partial date/time formats are also
accepted (see L<https://exiftool.org/faq.html#Q5>), C<boolean> is either
"True" or "False" (but "true" and "false" may be written as a ValueConv
value for compatibility with non-conforming applications), C<struct>
indicates a structured tag, and C<lang-alt> is a tag that supports alternate
languages.

When reading, C<struct> tags are extracted only if the Struct (-struct)
option is used.  Otherwise the corresponding I<Flattened> tags, indicated by
an underline (C<_>) after the B<Writable> type, are extracted.  When
copying, by default both structured and flattened tags are available, but
the flattened tags are considered "unsafe" so they aren't copied unless
specified explicitly.  The Struct option may be disabled by setting Struct
to 0 via the API or with --struct on the command line to copy only flattened
tags, or enabled by setting Struct to 1 via the API or with -struct on the
command line to copy only as structures.  When writing, the Struct option
has no effect, and both structured and flattened tags may be written.  See
L<https://exiftool.org/struct.html> for more details.

Individual languages for C<lang-alt> tags are accessed by suffixing the tag
name with a '-', followed by an RFC 3066 language code (eg. "XMP:Title-fr",
or "Rights-en-US").  (See L<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt> for the RFC
3066 specification.)  A C<lang-alt> tag with no language code accesses the
"x-default" language, but causes other languages for this tag to be deleted
when writing.  The "x-default" language code may be specified when writing
to preserve other existing languages (eg. "XMP-dc:Description-x-default"). 
When reading, "x-default" is not specified.

The XMP tags are organized according to schema B<Namespace> in the following
tables.  The ExifTool family 1 group names are derived from the namespace
prefixes by adding a leading "XMP-" (eg. "XMP-dc").  A few of the longer
prefixes have been shortened (as mentioned in the documentation below) to
avoid excessively long ExifTool group names.  The tags of any namespace may
be deleted as a group by specifying the family 1 group name (eg.
"-XMP-dc:all=" on the command line).  This includes namespaces which are not
pre-defined by ExifTool.

In cases where a tag name exists in more than one namespace, less common
namespaces are avoided when writing.  However, a specific namespace may be
written by providing a family 1 group name for the tag (eg. XMP-crs:Contrast
or XMP-exif:Contrast).  When deciding on which tags to add to an image,
using standard schemas such as L<dc|/XMP dc Tags>, L<xmp|/XMP xmp Tags>,
L<iptcCore|/XMP iptcCore Tags> and L<iptcExt|/XMP iptcExt Tags> is
recommended if possible.

For structures, the heading of the first column is B<Field Name>.  Field
names are very similar to tag names, except they are used to identify fields
inside structures instead of stand-alone tags.  See
L<https://exiftool.org/struct.html#Fields> for more
details.

ExifTool will extract XMP information even if it is not listed in these
tables, but other tags are not writable unless added as user-defined tags in
the ExifTool config file.  For example, the C<pdfx> namespace doesn't have a
predefined set of tag names because it is used to store application-defined
PDF information, so although this information will be extracted, it is only
writable if the corresponding user-defined tags have been created.

The tables below list tags from the official XMP specification (with an
underlined B<Namespace> in the HTML version of this documentation), as well
as extensions from various other sources.  See
L<http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/> for the official XMP specification.

=head3 XMP acdsee Tags

ACD Systems ACDSee namespace tags.

(A note to software developers: Re-inventing your own private tags instead
of using the equivalent tags in standard XMP namespaces defeats one of the
most valuable features of metadata: interoperability.  Your applications
mumble to themselves instead of speaking out for the rest of the world to
hear.)

These tags belong to the ExifTool XMP-acdsee family 1 group.

=head3 XMP aux Tags

Adobe-defined auxiliary EXIF tags.  This namespace existed in the XMP
specification until it was dropped in 2012, presumably due to the
introduction of the EXIF 2.3 for XMP specification and the exifEX namespace
at this time.  For this reason, tags below with equivalents in the
L<exifEX namespace|/XMP exifEX Tags> are avoided when writing.

These tags belong to the ExifTool XMP-aux family 1 group.

=head3 XMP RangeMask Struct

element which is a RangeMaskMapInfo structure (Yes, really!).  So these are
renamed to RangeMask and MapInfo respectively to avoid confusion and
redundancy in the tag names.

=head3 XMP ImageRegion Struct

This structure is new in the IPTC Extension version 1.5 specification.  As
well as the fields defined below, this structure may contain any top-level
XMP tags, but since they aren't pre-defined the only way to add these tags
is to write ImageRegion as a structure with these tags as new fields.

=head3 XMP SVG Tags

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image tags.  By default, only the top-level
SVG and Metadata tags are extracted from these images, but all graphics tags
may be extracted by setting the Unknown option to 2 (-U on the command
line).  The SVG tags are not part of XMP as such, but are included with the
XMP module for convenience.  (see L<http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/>)

These tags belong to the ExifTool XMP-svg family 1 group.

=head2 GPS Tags

These GPS tags are part of the EXIF standard, and are stored in a separate
IFD within the EXIF information.

ExifTool is very flexible about the input format when writing lat/long
coordinates, and will accept from 1 to 3 floating point numbers (for decimal
degrees, degrees and minutes, or degrees, minutes and seconds) separated by
just about anything, and will format them properly according to the EXIF
specification.

Some GPS tags have values which are fixed-length strings. For these, the
indicated string lengths include a null terminator which is added
automatically by ExifTool.  Remember that the descriptive values are used
when writing (eg. 'Above Sea Level', not '0') unless the print conversion is
disabled (with '-n' on the command line or the PrintConv option in the API,
or by suffixing the tag name with a C<#> character).

When adding GPS information to an image, it is important to set all of the
following tags: GPSLatitude, GPSLatitudeRef, GPSLongitude, GPSLongitudeRef,
and GPSAltitude and GPSAltitudeRef if the altitude is known.  ExifTool will
write the required GPSVersionID tag automatically if new a GPS IFD is added
to an image.

=head2 GeoTiff Tags

ExifTool extracts the following tags from GeoTIFF images.  See
L<https://web.archive.org/web/20070820121549/http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/spec/geotiffhome.html>
for the complete GeoTIFF specification.  Also included in the table below
are ChartTIFF tags (see
L<https://web.archive.org/web/20020828193928/http://www.charttiff.com/whitepapers.shtml>).
GeoTIFF tags are not writable individually, but they may be copied en mass
via the block tags GeoTiffDirectory, GeoTiffDoubleParams and
GeoTiffAsciiParams.

=head2 PLUS Tags

=head3 PLUS XMP Tags

PLUS (Picture Licensing Universal System) License Data Format 2.0.1 XMP
tags.  Note that all controlled-vocabulary tags in this table (ie. tags with
a fixed set of values) have raw values which begin with
"http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/", but to reduce clutter this prefix has
been removed from the values shown below, and from the values read and
written with the -n option.  See L<http://ns.useplus.org/> for the complete
specification.

These tags belong to the ExifTool XMP-plus family 1 group.

=head2 ICC_Profile Tags

ICC profile information is used in many different file types including JPEG,
TIFF, PDF, PostScript, Photoshop, PNG, MIFF, PICT, QuickTime, XCF and some
RAW formats.  While the tags listed below are not individually writable, the
entire profile itself can be accessed via the extra 'ICC_Profile' tag, but
this tag is neither extracted nor written unless specified explicitly.  See
L<http://www.color.org/icc_specs2.xalter> for the official ICC
specification.

=head2 Photoshop Tags

Photoshop tags are found in PSD and PSB files, as well as inside embedded
Photoshop information in many other file types (JPEG, TIFF, PDF, PNG to name
a few).

Many Photoshop tags are marked as Unknown (indicated by a question mark
after the tag name) because the information they provide is not very useful
under normal circumstances.  These unknown tags are not extracted unless the
Unknown (-u) option is used.  See
L<http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/> for the
official specification

Photoshop path tags (Tag ID's 0x7d0 to 0xbb5) are not defined by default,
but a config file included in the full ExifTool distribution
(config_files/photoshop_paths.config) contains the tag definitions to allow
access to this information.

=head3 Canon CameraInfo1D Tags

Information in the "CameraInfo" records is tricky to decode because the
encodings are very different than in other Canon records (even sometimes
switching endianness between values within a single camera), plus there is
considerable variation in format from model to model. The first table below
lists CameraInfo tags for the 1D and 1DS.

=head3 Canon AFInfo Tags

Auto-focus information used by many older Canon models.  The values in this
record are sequential, and some have variable sizes based on the value of
NumAFPoints (which may be 1,5,7,9,15,45 or 53).  The AFArea coordinates are
given in a system where the image has dimensions given by AFImageWidth and
AFImageHeight, and 0,0 is the image center. The direction of the Y axis
depends on the camera model, with positive Y upwards for EOS models, but
apparently downwards for PowerShot models.

=head3 CanonCustom Functions2 Tags

Beginning with the EOS 1D Mark III, Canon finally created a set of custom
function tags which are (reasonably) consistent across models.  The EOS 1D
Mark III has 57 custom function tags divided into four main groups: 1.
Exposure (0x0101-0x010f), 2. Image (0x0201-0x0203), Flash Exposure
(0x0304-0x0306) and Display (0x0407-0x0409), 3. Auto Focus (0x0501-0x050e)
and Drive (0x060f-0x0611), and 4. Operation (0x0701-0x070a) and Others
(0x080b-0x0810).  The table below lists tags used by the EOS 1D Mark III, as
well as newer tags and values added by later models.

=head3 DJI Protobuf Tags

Tags found in protobuf-format DJI djmd and dbgi timed metadata.  The known
tags listed below are extracted by default, but unknown djmd tags may be
extracted as well by setting the Unknown option to 1, or 2 to also extract
unknown dbgi debug tags.  Tag ID's are composed of the corresponding .proto
file name combined with the hierarchical protobuf field numbers.

ExifTool currently extracts timed GPS plus a few other tags from DJI devices
which use the following protocols:  dvtm_AVATA2.proto (Avata 2),
dvtm_ac203.proto (Osmo Action 4), dvtm_ac204.proto (Osmo Action 5),
dvtm_wm265e.proto (Mavic 3), dvtm_pm320.proto (Matrice 30) and
dvtm_pm320.proto (Mini 4 Pro).

Note that with the protobuf format, numerical tags missing from the output
for a given protocol should be considered to have the default value of 0.

=head3 FLIR RawData Tags

The thermal image data may be stored either as raw data, or in PNG format.
If stored as raw data, ExifTool adds a TIFF header to allow the data to be
viewed as a TIFF image.  If stored in PNG format, the PNG image is extracted
as-is.  Note that most FLIR cameras using the PNG format seem to write the
16-bit raw image data in the wrong byte order.

The maker notes of models such as the C340, C433, CC533, LS755, V803 and
V1003 seem to start with the camera serial number.  The C310, C315, C330,
C643, C743, CD33, CD43, CX7220 and CX7300 maker notes are also decoded using
this table, although the strings for these cameras don't conform to the
usual Kodak serial number format, and instead have the model name followed
by 8 digits.

=head3 Kodak Type8 Tags

Kodak models such as the ZD710, P712, P850, P880, V1233, V1253, V1275,
V1285, Z612, Z712, Z812, Z885 use standard TIFF IFD format for the maker
notes.  In keeping with Kodak's strategy of inconsistent makernotes, models
such as the M380, M1033, M1093, V1073, V1273, Z1012, Z1085 and Z8612
also use these tags, but these makernotes begin with a TIFF header instead
of an IFD entry count and use relative instead of absolute offsets.  There
is a large amount of information stored in these maker notes (apparently
with much duplication), but relatively few tags have so far been decoded.

=head3 Leaf SubIFD Tags

Leaf writes a TIFF-format sub-IFD inside IFD0 of a MOS image.  No tags in
this sub-IFD are currently known, except for tags 0x8602 and 0x8606 which
really shouldn't be here anyway (so they don't appear in the table below)
because they duplicate references to the same data from tags with the same
ID in IFD0.

=head2 Lytro Tags

Tag definitions for Lytro Light Field Picture (LFP) files.  ExifTool
extracts the full JSON metadata blocks, as well as breaking them down into
individual tags.  All available tags are extracted from the JSON metadata,
even if they don't appear in the table below.

=head2 Minolta Tags

These tags are used by Minolta, Konica/Minolta as well as some Sony cameras.
Minolta doesn't make things easy for decoders because the meaning of some
tags and the location where some information is stored is different for
different camera models.  (Take MinoltaQuality for example, which may be
located in 5 different places.)

=head3 Minolta CameraSettings Tags

There is some variability in CameraSettings information between different
models (and sometimes even between different firmware versions), so this
information may not be as reliable as it should be.  Because of this, tags
in the following tables are set to lower priority to prevent them from
superseding the values of same-named tags in other locations when duplicate
tags are disabled.

=head2 NikonCustom Tags

Unfortunately, the NikonCustom settings are stored in a binary data block
which changes from model to model.  This means that significant effort must
be spent in decoding these for each model, usually requiring hundreds of
test images from a dedicated Nikon owner.  For this reason, the NikonCustom
settings have not been decoded for all models.  The tables below list the
custom settings for the currently supported models.

=head3 Samsung IFD Tags

This is a standard-format IFD found in the maker notes of some Samsung
models, except that the entry count is a 4-byte integer and the offsets are
relative to the end of the IFD.  Currently, no tags in this IFD are known,
so the Unknown (-u) or Verbose (-v) option must be used to see this
information.

=head3 Sony SRF Tags

The maker notes in SRF (Sony Raw Format) images contain 7 IFD's with family
1 group names SRF0 through SRF6.  SRF0 and SRF1 use the tags in this table,
while SRF2 through SRF5 use the tags in the next table, and SRF6 uses
standard EXIF tags.  All information other than SRF0 is encrypted, but
thanks to Dave Coffin the decryption algorithm is known.  SRF images are
written by the Sony DSC-F828 and DSC-V3.

=head3 Sony SR2Private Tags

The SR2 format uses the DNGPrivateData tag to reference a private IFD
containing these tags.  SR2 images are written by the Sony DSC-R1, but
this information is also written to ARW images by other models.

=head2 DNG Tags

The main DNG tags are found in the EXIF table.  The tables below define only
information found within structures of these main DNG tag values.  See
L<https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/digital-negative.html> for the official
DNG specification.

=head3 DNG AdobeData Tags

This information is found in the "Adobe" DNGPrivateData.

The maker notes ('MakN') are processed by ExifTool, but some information may
have been lost by the Adobe DNG Converter.  This is because the Adobe DNG
Converter (as of version 6.3) doesn't properly handle information referenced
from inside the maker notes that lies outside the original maker notes
block.  This information is lost when only the maker note block is copied to
the DNG image.   While this doesn't effect all makes of cameras, it is a
problem for some major brands such as Olympus and Sony.

Other entries in this table represent proprietary information that is
extracted from the original RAW image and restructured to a different (but
still proprietary) Adobe format.

=head2 PLIST Tags

Apple Property List tags.  ExifTool reads both XML and binary-format PLIST
files, and will extract any existing tags even if they aren't listed below.
These tags belong to the family 0 "PLIST" group, but family 1 group may be
either "XML" or "PLIST" depending on whether the format is XML or binary.

=head2 CanonRaw Tags

These tags apply to CRW-format Canon RAW files and information in the APP0
"CIFF" segment of JPEG images.  When writing CanonRaw/CIFF information, the
length of the information is preserved (and the new information is truncated
or padded as required) unless B<Writable> is C<resize>. Currently, only
JpgFromRaw and ThumbnailImage are allowed to change size.  See
L<https://exiftool.org/canon_raw.html> for a description of the Canon CRW
format.

CRW images also support the addition of a CanonVRD trailer, which in turn
supports XMP.  This trailer is created automatically if necessary when
ExifTool is used to write XMP to a CRW image.

=head2 SigmaRaw Tags

These tags are used in Sigma and Foveon RAW (.X3F) images.  Metadata is also
extracted from the JpgFromRaw image if it exists (all models but the SD9 and
SD10).  Currently, metadata may only be written to the embedded JpgFromRaw.

=head2 FlashPix Tags

The FlashPix file format, introduced in 1996, was developed by Kodak,
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.  Internally the FPX file structure mimics
that of an old DOS disk with fixed-sized "sectors" (usually 512 bytes) and a
"file allocation table" (FAT).  No wonder this image format never became
popular.  However, some of the structures used in FlashPix streams are part
of the EXIF specification, and are still being used in the APP2 FPXR segment
of JPEG images by some digital cameras from manufacturers such as FujiFilm,
Hewlett-Packard, Kodak and Sanyo.

ExifTool extracts FlashPix information from both FPX images and the APP2
FPXR segment of JPEG images.  As well, FlashPix information is extracted
from DOC, PPT, XLS (Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel) documents, VSD
(Microsoft Visio) drawings, and FLA (Macromedia/Adobe Flash project) files
since these are based on the same file format as FlashPix (the Windows
Compound Binary File format).  Note that ExifTool identifies any
unrecognized Windows Compound Binary file as a FlashPix (FPX) file.  See
L<http://graphcomp.com/info/specs/livepicture/fpx.pdf> for the FlashPix
specification.

Note that Microsoft is not consistent with the time zone used for some
date/time tags, and it may be either UTC or local time depending on the
software used to create the file.

=head2 MPF Tags

These tags are part of the CIPA Multi-Picture Format specification, and are
found in the APP2 "MPF" segment of JPEG images.  MPImage data referenced
from this segment is stored as a JPEG trailer.  The MPF tags are not
writable, however the MPF segment may be deleted as a group (with "MPF:All")
but then the JPEG trailer should also be deleted (with "Trailer:All").  See
L<https://web.archive.org/web/20190713230858/http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DC-007_E.pdf>
for the official specification.

=head2 Jpeg2000 Tags

The tags below are found in JPEG 2000 images and the C2PA CAI JUMBF metadata
in various file types (see below).  Note that ExifTool currently writes only
EXIF, IPTC and XMP tags in Jpeg2000 images, and EXIF and XMP in JXL images.
ExifTool will read/write Brotli-compressed EXIF and XMP in JXL images, but
the API Compress option must be set to create new EXIF and XMP in compressed
format.

C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) CAI (Content
Authenticity Initiative) JUMBF (JPEG Universal Metadata Box Format) metdata
is currently extracted from JPEG, PNG, TIFF-based (eg. TIFF, DNG),
QuickTime-based (eg. MP4, MOV, HEIF, AVIF), RIFF-based (eg. WAV, AVI, WebP),
PDF, SVG and GIF files, and ID3v2 metadata.  The suggested ExifTool
command-line arguments for reading C2PA metadata are C<-jumbf:all -G3 -b -j
-u -struct>.  This metadata may be deleted from writable JPEG, PNG, WebP,
TIFF-based, and QuickTime-based files by deleting the JUMBF group with
C<-jumbf:all=>.  The C2PA JUMBF metadata may be extracted as a block via the
JUMBF tag.  See L<https://c2pa.org/specifications/> for the C2PA
specification.

=head3 Jpeg2000 ColorSpec Tags

The table below contains tags in the color specification (colr) box.  This
box may be rewritten by writing either ICC_Profile, ColorSpace or
ColorSpecData.  When writing, any existing colr boxes are replaced with the
newly created colr box.

B<NOTE>: Care must be taken when writing this color specification because
writing a specification that is incompatible with the image data may make
the image undisplayable.

=head2 AFCP Tags

AFCP stands for AXS File Concatenation Protocol, and is a poorly designed
protocol for appending information to the end of files.  This can be used as
an auxiliary technique to store IPTC information in images, but is
incompatible with some file formats.

ExifTool will read and write (but not create) AFCP IPTC information in JPEG
and TIFF images.

See
L<http://web.archive.org/web/20080828211305/http://www.tocarte.com/media/axs_afcp_spec.pdf>
for the AFCP specification.

=head3 Microsoft Xtra Tags

Tags found in the Microsoft "Xtra" atom of QuickTime videos.  Tag ID's are
not shown because some are unruly GUID's.  Currently most of these tags are
not writable because the Microsoft documentation is poor and samples were
not available, but more tags may be made writable in the future if samples
are provided.  Note that writable tags in this table are are flagged to
"Avoid", which means that other more common tags will be written instead if
possible unless the Microsoft group is specified explicitly.

=head2 MIE Tags

MIE is a flexible format which may be used as a stand-alone meta information
format, for encapsulation of other files and information, or as a trailer
appended to other file formats.  The tables below represent currently
defined MIE tags, however ExifTool will also extract any other information
present in a MIE file.

When writing MIE information, some special features are supported:

1) String values may be written as ASCII (ISO 8859-1) or UTF-8.  ExifTool
automatically detects the presence of wide characters and treats the string
appropriately. Internally, UTF-8 text may be converted to UTF-16 or UTF-32
and stored in this format in the file if it is more compact.

2) All MIE string-value tags support localized text.  Localized values are
written by adding a language/country code to the tag name in the form
C<TAG-xx_YY>, where C<TAG> is the tag name, C<xx> is a 2-character lower
case ISO 639-1 language code, and C<YY> is a 2-character upper case ISO
3166-1 alpha 2 country code (eg. C<Title-en_US>).  But as usual, the user
interface is case-insensitive, and ExifTool will write the correct case to
the file.

3) Some numerical MIE tags allow units of measurement to be specified.  For
these tags, units may be added in brackets immediately following the value
(eg. C<55(mi/h)>).  If no units are specified, the default units are
written.

4) ExifTool writes compressed metadata to MIE files if the Compress (-z)
option is used and Compress::Zlib is available.

See L<https://exiftool.org/MIE1.1-20070121.pdf> for the official MIE
specification.

=head3 MIE Audio Tags

For the Audio group (and any other group containing a 'data' element), tags
refer to the contained data if present, otherwise they refer to the main
SubfileData.  The C<0Type> and C<1Name> elements should exist only if C<data>
is present.

=head3 Trailer Google Tags

Google-defined information written in the trailer of JPEG images by some
phones.  This information is referenced by DirectoryItem entries in the XMP.
Note that some of this information may also be referenced from other
metadata formats, and hence may be extracted twice.  For example,
MotionPhotoVideo may also exist within a Samsung trailer as
EmbbededVideoFile, or GainMapImage may also exist in an MPF trailer as
MPImage2.

ImageHeight and X/YResolution are extracted from a PICT image.  Tags in the
following table represent image opcodes.  Extraction of these tags is
experimental, and is only enabled with the Verbose or Unknown options.

=head2 PNG Tags

Tags extracted from PNG images.  See
L<http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/> for the official PNG 1.2
specification.

According to the specification, a PNG file should end at the IEND chunk,
however ExifTool will preserve any data found after this when writing unless
it is specifically deleted with C<-Trailer:All=>.  When reading, a minor
warning is issued if this trailer exists, and ExifTool will attempt to parse
this data as additional PNG chunks.

Also according to the PNG specification, there is no restriction on the
location of text-type chunks (tEXt, zTXt and iTXt).  However, certain
utilities (including some Apple and Adobe utilities) won't read the XMP iTXt
chunk if it comes after the IDAT chunk, and at least one utility won't read
other text chunks here.  For this reason, when writing, ExifTool 11.63 and
later create new text chunks (including XMP) before IDAT, and move existing
text chunks to before IDAT.

The PNG format contains CRC checksums that are validated when reading with
either the Verbose or Validate option.  When writing, these checksums are
validated by default, but the FastScan option may be used to bypass this
check if speed is more of a concern.

=head3 PNG TextualData Tags

The PNG TextualData format allows arbitrary tag names to be used.  The tags
listed below are the only ones that can be written (unless new user-defined
tags are added via the configuration file), however ExifTool will extract
any other TextualData tags that are found.  All TextualData tags (including
tags not listed below) are removed when deleting all PNG tags.

These tags may be stored as tEXt, zTXt or iTXt chunks in the PNG image.  By
default ExifTool writes new string-value tags as as uncompressed tEXt, or
compressed zTXt if the Compress (-z) option is used and Compress::Zlib is
available.  Alternate language tags and values containing special characters
(unless the Latin character set is used) are written as iTXt, and compressed
if the Compress option is used and Compress::Zlib is available.  Raw profile
information is always created as compressed zTXt if Compress::Zlib is
available, or tEXt otherwise.  Standard XMP is written as uncompressed iTXt.
User-defined tags may set an 'iTXt' flag in the tag definition to be written
only as iTXt.

Alternate languages are accessed by suffixing the tag name with a '-',
followed by an RFC 3066 language code (eg. "PNG:Comment-fr", or
"Title-en-US").  See L<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt> for the RFC 3066
specification.

Some of the tags below are not registered as part of the PNG specification,
but are included here because they are generated by other software such as
ImageMagick.

=head2 MNG Tags

This table contains definitions for tags found in MNG and JNG images.  MNG
is a superset of PNG and JNG, so a MNG image may contain any of these tags
as well as any PNG tags.  Conversely, only some of these tags are valid for
JNG images.

=head3 DjVu Meta Tags

This table lists the standard DjVu metadata tags, but ExifTool will extract
any tags that exist even if they don't appear here.  The DjVu v3
documentation endorses tags borrowed from two standards: 1) BibTeX
bibliography system tags (all lowercase Tag ID's in the table below), and 2)
PDF DocInfo tags (capitalized Tag ID's).

=head2 PDF Tags

The tags listed in the PDF tables below are those which are used by ExifTool
to extract meta information, but they are only a small fraction of the total
number of available PDF tags.  See
L<http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html> for the official PDF
specification.

ExifTool supports reading and writing PDF documents up to version 2.0,
including support for RC4, AES-128 and AES-256 encryption.  A
Password option is provided to allow processing
of password-protected PDF files.

ExifTool may be used to write native PDF and XMP metadata to PDF files. It
uses an incremental update technique that has the advantages of being both
fast and reversible.  If ExifTool was used to modify a PDF file, the
original may be recovered by deleting the C<PDF-update> pseudo-group (with
C<-PDF-update:all=> on the command line).  However, there are two main
disadvantages to this technique:

1) A linearized PDF file is no longer linearized after the update, so it
must be subsequently re-linearized if this is required.

2) All metadata edits are reversible.  While this would normally be
considered an advantage, it is a potential security problem because old
information is never actually deleted from the file.  (However, after
running ExifTool the old information may be removed permanently using the
"qpdf" utility with this command: "qpdf --linearize in.pdf out.pdf".)

=head3 PDF Info Tags

As well as the tags listed below, the PDF specification allows for
user-defined tags to exist in the Info dictionary.  These tags, which should
have corresponding XMP-pdfx entries in the XMP of the PDF XML Metadata
object, are also extracted by ExifTool.

B<Writable> specifies the value format, and may be C<string>, C<date>,
C<integer>, C<real>, C<boolean> or C<name> for PDF tags.

=head2 ID3 Tags

ExifTool extracts ID3 and Lyrics3 information from MP3, MPEG, WAV, AIFF,
OGG, FLAC, APE, MPC and RealAudio files.  ID3v2 tags which support multiple
languages (eg. Comment and Lyrics) are extracted by specifying the tag name,
followed by a dash ('-'), then a 3-character ISO 639-2 language code (eg.
"Comment-spa"). See L<https://id3.org/> for the official ID3 specification
and L<http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php> for a list of
ISO 639-2 language codes.

=head2 QuickTime Tags

The QuickTime format is used for many different types of audio, video and
image files (most notably, MOV/MP4 videos and HEIC/CR3 images).  ExifTool
extracts standard meta information and a variety of audio, video and image
parameters, as well as proprietary information written by many camera
models.  Tags with a question mark after their name are not extracted unless
the Unknown option is set.

When writing video files, ExifTool creates both QuickTime and XMP tags by
default, but the group may be specified to write one or the other
separately.  If no location is specified, newly created QuickTime tags are
added in the L<ItemList|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime ItemList Tags>
location if possible, otherwise in
L<UserData|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime UserData Tags>, and
finally in L<Keys|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime Keys Tags>,
but this order may be changed by setting the PREFERRED level of the
appropriate table in the config file (see
example.config in the full distribution for an
example).  Note that some tags with the same name but different ID's may
exist in the same location, but the family 7 group names may be used to
differentiate these.

ExifTool currently writes
L<ItemList|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime ItemList Tags> and
L<UserData|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime UserData Tags> only as
top-level metadata, but select Keys tags are may be written to the audio or
video track.  See the
L<AudioKeys|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime AudioKeys Tags> and
L<VideoKeys|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime VideoKeys Tags> tags for
more information.

Alternate language tags may be accessed for
L<ItemList|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime ItemList Tags> and
L<Keys|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime Keys Tags> tags by adding
a 3-character ISO 639-2 language code and an optional ISO 3166-1 alpha 2
country code to the tag name (eg. "ItemList:Artist-deu" or
"ItemList::Artist-deu-DE").  Most
L<UserData|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime UserData Tags> tags support a
language code, but without a country code.  If no language code is specified
when writing, the default language is written and alternate languages for
the tag are deleted.  Use the "und" language code to write the default
language without deleting alternate languages.  Note that when reading,
"eng" is also treated as the default language if there is no country code.

According to the specification, integer-format QuickTime date/time tags
should be stored as UTC.  Unfortunately, digital cameras often store local
time values instead (presumably because they don't know the time zone).  For
this reason, by default ExifTool does not assume a time zone for these
values.  However, if the API QuickTimeUTC option is set, then ExifTool will
assume these values are properly stored as UTC, and will convert them to
local time when extracting.

When writing string-based date/time tags, the system time zone is added if
the PrintConv option is enabled and no time zone is specified.  This is
because Apple software may display crazy values if the time zone is missing
for some tags.

By default ExifTool will remove null padding from some QuickTime containers
in Canon CR3 files when writing, but the
QuickTimePad option may be used to preserve
the original size by padding with nulls if necessary.

See
L<https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/>
for the official QuickTime specification.

=head3 QuickTime Stream Tags

The tags below are extracted from timed metadata in QuickTime and other
formats of video files when the ExtractEmbedded option is used.  Although
most of these tags are combined into the single table below, ExifTool
currently reads 110 different types of timed GPS metadata from video files.

=head3 QuickTime Keys Tags

This directory contains a list of key names which are used to decode tags
written by the "mdta" handler.  Also in this table are a few tags found in
timed metadata that are not yet writable by ExifTool.  The prefix of
"com.apple.quicktime." has been removed from the TagID's below.  These tags
support alternate languages in the same way as the
L<ItemList|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime ItemList Tags> tags.  Note
that by default,
L<ItemList|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime ItemList Tags> and
L<UserData|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime UserData Tags> tags are
preferred when writing, so to create a tag when a same-named tag exists in
either of these tables, either the "Keys" location must be specified (eg.
C<-Keys:Author=Phil> on the command line), or the PREFERRED level must be
changed via the config file.

=head3 QuickTime ItemList Tags

This is the preferred location for creating new QuickTime tags.  Tags in
this table support alternate languages which are accessed by adding a
3-character ISO 639-2 language code and an optional ISO 3166-1 alpha 2
country code to the tag name (eg. "ItemList:Title-fra" or
"ItemList::Title-fra-FR").  When creating a new Meta box to contain the
ItemList directory, by default ExifTool adds an 'mdir' (Metadata) Handler
box because Apple software may ignore ItemList tags otherwise, but the API
QuickTimeHandler option may be set to 0 to avoid this.

=head3 QuickTime UserData Tags

Tag ID's beginning with the copyright symbol (hex 0xa9) are multi-language
text.  Alternate language tags are accessed by adding a dash followed by a
3-character ISO 639-2 language code to the tag name.  ExifTool will extract
any multi-language user data tags found, even if they aren't in this table.
Note when creating new tags,
L<ItemList|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/QuickTime ItemList Tags> tags are
preferred over these, so to create the tag when a same-named ItemList tag
exists, either "UserData" must be specified (eg. C<-UserData:Artist=Monet>
on the command line), or the PREFERRED level must be changed via
the config file.

=head2 RIFF Tags

The RIFF container format is used various types of fines including AVI, WAV,
WEBP, LA, OFR, PAC and WV.  According to the EXIF specification, Meta
information is embedded in two types of RIFF C<LIST> chunks: C<INFO> and
C<exif>, and information about the audio content is stored in the C<fmt >
chunk.  As well as this information, some video information and proprietary
manufacturer-specific information is also extracted.

Large AVI videos may be a concatenation of two or more RIFF chunks.  For
these files, information is extracted from subsequent RIFF chunks as
sub-documents, but the Duration is calculated for the full video.

ExifTool currently has the ability to write EXIF, XMP and ICC_Profile
metadata to WEBP images, but can't yet write to other RIFF-based formats.

=head2 GM Tags

These tags are extracted from GM/Cosworth PDR (Performance Data Recorder)
information found in videos from General Motors cars such as Corvette and
Camero.

Use the API PrintCSV option to output all timed
PDR data in CSV format at greatly increased speed and with much lower memory
usage.  This option prints the numerical values for each channel in CSV
format, suitable for import into RaceRender.  In this output, the gear
numbers for Neutral and Reverse are changed to -1 and -100 respectively for
compatibility with RaceRender.

=head3 GM marl Tags

Tags extracted from the 'ctbx' 'marl' (Marlin) box of timed PDR metadata
from GM cars.  Use the -ee (API ExtractEmbedded) option to extract this
information, or the API PrintCSV option to output in CSV format.

The following tags are decoded from the Modified Digital Video Pack Metadata
(MDPM) of the unregistered user data with UUID
17ee8c60f84d11d98cd60800200c9a66 in the H.264 Supplemental Enhancement
Information (SEI).  I<[Yes, this description is confusing, but nothing
compared to the challenge of actually decoding the data!]>  This information
may exist at regular intervals through the entire video, but only the first
occurrence is extracted unless the ExtractEmbedded (-ee) option is used (in
which case subsequent occurrences are extracted as sub-documents).

=head2 Matroska Tags

The following tags are extracted from Matroska multimedia container files.
This container format is used by file types such as MKA, MKV, MKS and WEBM.
For speed, by default ExifTool extracts tags only up to the first Cluster
unless a Seek element specifies the position of a Tags element after this.
However, the Verbose (-v) and Unknown = 2 (-U) options force processing of
Cluster data, and the ExtractEmbedded (-ee) option skips over Clusters to
read subsequent tags.  See
L<http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/index.html> for the official
Matroska specification.

format.  (As far as I can tell from the referenced documentation, string
values should be plain text, but this is not the case for the only sample
file I have been able to obtain containing this information.  These tags
could also be split into separate sub-directories, but this will wait until
I have better documentation or a more complete set of samples.)

=head2 DICOM Tags

The DICOM format is based on the ACR-NEMA specification, but adds a file
header and a number of new tags.  ExifTool will extract information from
either type of file.  The Tag ID's in the following table are the tag group
and element numbers in hexadecimal, as given in the DICOM specification (see
L<http://medical.nema.org/>).  The table below contains tags from the DICOM
2009 and earlier specifications plus some vendor-specific private tags.

Note that DICOM information may be saved in other file formats using the
L<XMP DICOM Tags|Image::ExifTool::TagNames/XMP DICOM Tags>.

=head3 Font Name Tags

The following tags are extracted from the TrueType font "name" table found
in OTF, TTF, TTC and DFONT files.  These tags support localized languages by
adding a hyphen followed by a language code to the end of the tag name (eg.
"Copyright-fr" or "License-en-US").  Tags with no language code use the
default language of "en".

=head2 VCard Tags

This table lists common vCard tags, but ExifTool will also extract any other
vCard tags found.  Tag names may have "Pref" added to indicate the preferred
instance of a vCard property, and other "TYPE" parameters may also added to
the tag name.  VCF files may contain multiple vCard entries which are
distinguished by the ExifTool family 3 group name (document  number). See
L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350> for the vCard 4.0 specification.

=head3 VCard VCalendar Tags

The VCard module is also used to process iCalendar ICS files since they use
a format similar to vCard.  The following table lists standard iCalendar
tags, but any existing tags will be extracted.  Top-level iCalendar
components (eg. Event, Todo, Timezone, etc.) are used for the family 1 group
names, and embedded components (eg. Alarm) are added as a prefix to the tag
name.  See L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545> for the official iCalendar
2.0 specification.

=head2 Text Tags

Although basic text files contain no metadata, the following tags are
determined from a simple analysis of the data in TXT and CSV files.
Statistics are generated only for 8-bit encodings, but the FastScan (-fast)
option may be used to limit processing to the first 64 KiB in which case
some tags are not produced.  To avoid long processing delays, ExifTool will
issue a minor warning and process only the first 64 KiB of any file larger
than 20 MiB unless the IgnoreMinorErrors (-m) option is used.

=head2 RSRC Tags

Tags extracted from Mac OS resource files, DFONT files and "._" sidecar
files.  These tags may also be extracted from the resource fork of any file
in OS X, either by adding "/..namedfork/rsrc" to the filename to process the
resource fork alone, or by using the ExtractEmbedded (-ee) option to process
the resource fork as a sub-document of the main file.  When writing,
ExifTool preserves the Mac OS resource fork by default, but it may deleted
with C<-rsrc:all=> on the command line.

=head2 OOXML Tags

The Office Open XML (OOXML) format was introduced with Microsoft Office 2007
and is used by file types such as DOCX, PPTX and XLSX.  These are
essentially ZIP archives containing XML files.  The table below lists some
tags which have been observed in OOXML documents, but ExifTool will extract
any tags found from XML files of the OOXML document properties ("docProps")
directory.

B<Tips:>

1) Structural ZIP tags may be ignored (if desired) with C<--ZIP:all> on the
command line.

2) Tags may be grouped by their document number in the ZIP archive with the
C<-g3> or C<-G3> option.

=head2 MacOS Tags

On MacOS systems, the there are additional MDItem and XAttr Finder tags that
may be extracted.  These tags are not extracted by default -- they must be
specifically requested or enabled via an API option.  (Except when reading
MacOS "._" files directly, see below.)

The tables below list some of the tags that may be extracted, but ExifTool
will extract all available information even for tags not listed.

Tags in these tables are referred to as "pseudo" tags because their
information is not stored in the file itself.  As such, B<Writable> tags in
these tables may be changed without having to rewrite the file.

Note that on some filesystems, MacOS creates sidecar files with names that
begin with "._".  ExifTool will read these files if specified, and extract
the information listed in the following table without the need for extra
options, but these files are not writable directly.

  Tag ID   Tag Name                             Writable
  ------   --------                             --------

  0x0009   ATTR                                 MacOS XAttr

=head3 MacOS XAttr Tags

XAttr tags are extracted using the "xattr" utility.  They are extracted if
any "XAttr*" tag or the MacOS group is specifically requested, or by setting
the API XAttrTags option to 1 or the API RequestAll option to 2 or higher.
And they are extracted by default from MacOS "._" files when reading
these files directly.

  Tag Name                                      Writable

=head3 MacOS MDItem Tags

MDItem tags are extracted using the "mdls" utility.  They are extracted if
any "MDItem*" tag or the MacOS group is specifically requested, or by
setting the API MDItemTags option to 1 or the API RequestAll option to 2 or
higher.  Note that these tags do not necessarily reflect the current
metadata of a file -- it may take some time for the MacOS mdworker daemon to
index the file after a metadata change.

=head2 Extra Tags

The extra tags provide extra features or extra information extracted or
generated by ExifTool that is not directly associated with another tag
group.  The B<Group> column lists the family 1 group name when reading. 
Tags with a "-" in this column are write-only.

Tags in the family 1 "System" group are referred to as "pseudo" tags because
they don't represent real metadata in the file.  Instead, this information
is stored in the directory structure of the filesystem.  The B<Writable>
System "pseudo" tags in this table may be written without modifying the file
itself.  The TestName tag is used for dry-run testing before writing
FileName.

=head2 Composite Tags

The values of the composite tags are B<Derived From> the values of other
tags.  These are convenience tags which are calculated after all other
information is extracted.  Only a few of these tags are writable directly,
the others are changed by writing the corresponding B<Derived From> tags.
User-defined Composite tags, also useful for custom-formatting of tag
values, may created via the ExifTool configuration file.

=head2 Shortcuts Tags

Shortcut tags are convenience tags that represent one or more other tag
names.  They are used like regular tags to read and write the information
for a specified set of tags.

The shortcut tags below have been pre-defined, but user-defined shortcuts
may be added via the %Image::ExifTool::UserDefined::Shortcuts lookup in the
=/.ExifTool_config file.  See the Image::ExifTool::Shortcuts documentation
for more details.

=head2 MWG Tags

The Metadata Working Group (MWG) recommends techniques to allow certain
overlapping EXIF, IPTC and XMP tags to be reconciled when reading, and
synchronized when writing.  The MWG Composite tags below are designed to aid
in the implementation of these recommendations.  As well, the MWG defines
new XMP tags which are listed in the subsequent tables below.  See
L<https://web.archive.org/web/20180919181934/http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf>
for the official MWG specification.

=head3 MWG Composite Tags

The table below lists special Composite tags which are used to access other
tags based on the MWG 2.0 recommendations.  These tags are only accessible
when explicitly loaded, but this is done automatically by the exiftool
application if MWG is specified as a group for any tag on the command line,
or manually with the C<-use MWG> option.  Via the API, the MWG Composite
tags are loaded by calling "C<Image::ExifTool::MWG::Load()>".

When reading, the value of each MWG tag is B<Derived From> the specified
tags based on the MWG guidelines.  When writing, the appropriate associated
tags are written.  The value of the IPTCDigest tag is updated automatically
when the IPTC is changed if either the IPTCDigest tag didn't exist
beforehand or its value agreed with the original IPTC digest (indicating
that the XMP is synchronized with the IPTC).  IPTC information is written
only if the original file contained IPTC.

Loading the MWG module activates "strict MWG conformance mode", which has
the effect of causing EXIF, IPTC and XMP in non-standard locations to be
ignored when reading, as per the MWG recommendations.  Instead, a "Warning"
tag is generated when non-standard metadata is encountered.  This feature
may be disabled by setting C<$Image::ExifTool::MWG::strict = 0> in the
ExifTool config file (or from your Perl script when using the API).  Note
that the behaviour when writing is not changed:  ExifTool always creates new
records only in the standard location, but writes new tags to any
EXIF/IPTC/XMP records that exist.

Contrary to the EXIF specification, the MWG recommends that EXIF "ASCII"
string values be stored as UTF-8.  To honour this, the exiftool application
sets the default internal EXIF string encoding to "UTF8" when the MWG module
is loaded, but via the API this must be done manually by setting the
CharsetEXIF option.

A complication of the MWG specification is that although the MWG:Creator
property may consist of multiple values, the associated EXIF tag
(EXIF:Artist) is only a simple string.  To resolve this discrepancy the MWG
recommends a technique which allows a list of values to be stored in a
string by using a semicolon-space separator (with quotes around values if
necessary).  When the MWG module is loaded, ExifTool automatically
implements this policy and changes EXIF:Artist to a list-type tag.

=head3 MWG Extensions Struct

This structure may contain any top-level XMP tags, but none have been
pre-defined in ExifTool.  Since no flattened tags have been pre-defined,
RegionExtensions is writable only as a structure (eg.
C<{xmp-dc:creator=me,rating=5}>).  Fields for this structure are identified
using the standard ExifTool tag name (with optional leading group name,
and/or trailing language code, and/or trailing C<#> symbol to disable print
conversion).

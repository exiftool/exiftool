  - Added documention of Canon RAW (CRW) file format

Jan. 27, 2005 - Version 4.41

  - Added write support for Canon exposure parameters
  - Change validation of CanonPictureInfo to get it working for Canon 20D

Jan. 26, 2005 - Version 4.40

  - Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space
  - Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
  - Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed
  - Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
  - Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)
  - API Changes:
      - Added 'Compact' option to not write blank padding as per XMP and IPTC
        specs

Jan. 24, 2005 - Version 4.36 (production release)

  - Added support for reading Olympus Raw Format (ORF)

Jan. 23, 2005 - Version 4.35

  - Moved a couple of the informational warnings to verbose mode
  - Suppress warnings an non-critical errors with -m option
  - Made a few more of the EXIF tags writable
  - Made model-dependent tags Pentax FocalLength and Olympus Quality writable
  - Added ability to write CanonCustom tags
  - Added range check for integer values

Jan. 21, 2005 - Version 4.34

  - Fixed problem when writing Canon maker notes with -allTagsFromFile
  - Added -o option to write to different file or directory
  - Added handler to clean up temporary file on Ctrl-C
  - Re-wrote routine to rationalize floating point values (it is slower now, but
    produces much prettier fractions)
  - Other minor improvements to writer code

Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.33

  - Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes
  - Make GPS latitude and longitude a bit more flexible about the format they
    accept when writing
  - Updates to documentation

Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.32

  - Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
  - Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
  - Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
  - No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character
  - Changed all DataDump tags to binary data types
  - Changed some warning messages
  - Documented the -m option (it's now official, even though it's been there
    since version 4.10)
  - Added some more writer tests

Jan. 18, 2005 - Version 4.31

  - Now also copies over preview image in Nikon NEF files

Jan. 18, 2005 - Version 4.30

  - Now copies over preview images in EXIF data (large, external previews still
    not copied)
  - Account for funny offsets in Casio EX-Z3 maker notes while extracting data
    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
  - Fixed bug introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.23

  - Improve handling of unrecognized maker notes when writing

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.22

  - Added check in -AllTagsFromFile to test for pointers in the maker notes
    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
    issued and the maker notes are rebuilt properly before copying.
  - Fixed problem which could corrupt some values when editing maker notes

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.21

  - Added Olympus Red/BlueBalance

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.20

  - Added ability to edit MakerNotes!
  - Added more validation when writing IPTC information
  - Fixed display of Nikon FlashExposureComp for negative values
  - Fixed problem where the large JPEG image in Nikon and Pentax raw files was
    misidentified as the ThumbnailImage.  It is now extracted as JpgFromRaw.
    This allows all 3 JPEG images contained in Pentax PEF files to be extracted:
    ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage and JpgFromRaw.
  - Fixed problem on systems that use backslashes in directory names that
    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
  - Changed many Pentax tag names to remove "Pentax" prefix and conform more to
    the other tag names (moving information between files of different formats
    is much easier if tags have standardized names):
      - PentaxPictureMode => PictureMode
      - PentaxFocusMode => FocusMode
      - PentaxWhiteBalance => WhiteBalance
      - PentaxAEMetering => MeteringMode
      - PentaxFocalLength => FocalLength
      - PentaxZoom => DigitalZoom
      - PentaxSaturation => Saturation
      - PentaxContrast => Contrast
      - PentaxSharpness => Sharpness
  - Fixed FocalLength conversion for Pentax Optio S
  - Fixed printout of Nikon FileSystemVersion for older Nikon models
  - More improvements to reliabilty of preview image extraction
  - Fixed Quality for Olympus E-1

Jan. 12, 2005 - Version 4.15

    the various models of Pentax cameras
  - Added decoding of the Canon 20D custom functions and a new Canon20D shortcut
    (thanks to Christian Koller)

  - Improved logic in determining byte ordering of maker notes

Jan. 10, 2005 - Version 4.14

  - Changed descriptions for Aperture and Shutter Speed to drop the Av/Tv
    Canonism
  - Improved logic to recognize more types of unknown maker notes
  - Recognize a couple more values of the Canon WhiteBalance tag
  - Renamed IPTC 'SupplementalCategory' to 'SupplementalCategories'
  - Handle timezone in times
  - API Changes:

    format currently isn't supported (can use the -m option to write anyway,
    which will remove the RAW image data if this is a 1D file)
  - Don't add null terminator to UserComment, GPSProcessingMethod or
    GPSAreaInformation
  - Improved logic for handling command line tag names and exclusions,
    especially when associated with the -TagsFromFile option

  - Added powerful new information redirection feature to -TagsFromFile option
  - Added writable File:FileModifyDate tag which represents the filesystem
    date/time of last modification
  - Allow '*' to also be used as well as 'all' to represent all tags, although

    notes to avoid writing a large preview to the destination file (now you have
    to do this manually afterwards if this is what you want)
  - Fixed problem rewriting Olympus E1 maker note subdirectories
  - Only validate extracted images when Binary (-b) option is used
  - Rename Olympus PreviewImageAvailable to PreviewImageValid, and check/set

    missing tags when the -f option is used
  - Account for different encoding of Canon ExposureTime in 20D and 350D, and
    lower priority of Canon ExposureTime and FNumber so regular EXIF values take
    precedence because it appears these values may be model dependent (I hate it
    when that happens)

Apr. 6, 2005 - Version 4.94

  - Added support for Kodak DX3215 and DX3700
  - Improved Kodak decoding and changed some Kodak tag names

    XMP-xmp)

Mar. 2, 2005 - Version 4.80

  - The -n option now prints binary data values as "Binary data #### bytes"
  - API Changes: (NOTE: Change in API behaviour for binary data values)
      - Changed returned ValueConv values so that binary data is now returned as

Feb. 21, 2005 - Version 4.66

  - Recognize JPEG 2000 XMP UUID information
  - Extract Meta information from JPEG APP3
  - Yet more playing with XP characters (this has been a learning process for
    me). Now special characters show up properly in my OSX terminal window, and
    the reverse translation works so now they get written properly as well (for
    Perl 5.6.1 or greater anyway... Earlier versions don't have the required
    UTF-8 support to handle these special characters)

    codestream, and doesn't contain any metadata that ExifTool can extract)

Feb. 14, 2005 - Version 4.61

  - Don't print filename line when -p option used
  - JPEG 2000 improvements

  - Change validation of CanonPictureInfo to get it working for Canon 20D

Jan. 26, 2005 - Version 4.40

  - Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space
  - Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
  - Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed
  - Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
  - Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)

Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.33

  - Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes

    accept when writing
  - Updates to documentation

Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.32

  - Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
  - Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
  - Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
  - No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character
  - Changed all DataDump tags to binary data types

    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
  - Fixed bug introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.23

  - Improve handling of unrecognized maker notes when writing

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.22

  - Added check in -AllTagsFromFile to test for pointers in the maker notes
    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
    issued and the maker notes are rebuilt properly before copying.
  - Fixed problem which could corrupt some values when editing maker notes

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.21

  - Added Olympus Red/BlueBalance

Jan. 17, 2005 - Version 4.20

  - Added more validation when writing IPTC information
  - Fixed display of Nikon FlashExposureComp for negative values
  - Fixed problem where the large JPEG image in Nikon and Pentax raw files was
    misidentified as the ThumbnailImage.  It is now extracted as JpgFromRaw.
    This allows all 3 JPEG images contained in Pentax PEF files to be extracted:
    ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage and JpgFromRaw.
  - Fixed problem on systems that use backslashes in directory names that
    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
  - Changed many Pentax tag names to remove "Pentax" prefix and conform more to
    the other tag names (moving information between files of different formats
    is much easier if tags have standardized names):
      - PentaxPictureMode => PictureMode
      - PentaxFocusMode => FocusMode
      - PentaxWhiteBalance => WhiteBalance
      - PentaxAEMetering => MeteringMode
      - PentaxFocalLength => FocalLength

    writing)
  - Now processes all IFD's of TIFF imags (not just IFD0)
  - Added data length check in hex dump of verbose option
  - Allow group name to be specified as prefix to tag name on command line
  - Renamed a few Nikon tags: FlashExposureComp to FlashExposureBracketValue,
    FEC to FlashExposureComp, and ShutterReleaseMode to ShootingMode
  - Extract Nikon preview image
  - Changed descriptions for Aperture and Shutter Speed to drop the Av/Tv
    Canonism
  - Improved logic to recognize more types of unknown maker notes
  - Recognize a couple more values of the Canon WhiteBalance tag
  - Renamed IPTC 'SupplementalCategory' to 'SupplementalCategories'
  - Handle timezone in times
  - API Changes:
      - Fixed problem where first tag name passed to GetInfo() was ignored

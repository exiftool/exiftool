<h1 class='up'>Fix Corrupted Nikon NEF Images</h1>

<p>Downloading NEF images from newer Nikon cameras with <b>Nikon Transfer 1</b>
or older versions of <b>ViewNX 2</b> (and probably Capture NX 2) may result
in <b>corrupted NEF</b> images that can no longer be opened.</p>

<p>This utility <b>repairs these corrupted NEF images</b> for the D4, Df,
D600, D610, D750, D800, D800E, D810, D850, D3200, D5200, D5300, D5500, D7100,
D7200 and D7500.</p>

<p>It <b><u>DOES NOT REPAIR</u></b> images corrupted by <b>memory card
problems</b>, <b>disk errors</b>, or <b>other software</b>.
<i class=lt>[<b>Nikon NX-D</b> has also been known to corrupt images (possibly
related to changing the file byte ordering!), but these problems are
<b><u>not</u> fixed by this utility</b>.]</i></p>

<blockquote class=warn><b class=red>Warning!</b> If you modify the corrupted
images with any other software before fixing them with this utility, then the
raw image data may be permanently lost!  (This may happen for instance if you
use View NX2 to geotag the images after downloading.)</blockquote>

<p>Follow the instructions below for running this utility on
<a href="#win">Windows</a> or <a href="#mac">Mac / Linux</a> systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://exiftool.org/forum/index.php/topic,4220.msg20951.html#new">See this thread
in the ExifTool forum</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p>

<p><i class=lt>[Note that Nikon doesn't learn from their mistakes, and a similar problem
happened 2 years earlier with an older version of Nikon Transfer and the D5000
(<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/felipe/archive/2010/07/12/140879.aspx">read here</a>),
and the new Nikon NX-D software has other corruption issues.  The moral is:
Don't use Nikon Transfer <b>or any other utility that modifies the file</b> to
download your precious images!]</i></p>

<p>It is very sad that this Nikon software bug penalizes only loyal Nikon owners
(since it affects only people who had an older copy of the Nikon software from a
previous camera), yet Nikon customer support provides no help other than
suggesting that you contact your memory card manufacturer to see if the original
images can be restored.</p>

<hr><a name="win"></a><h2>Windows Users</h2>

<ol><li><b>Download and open</b> "<a href="https://exiftool.org/fix_corrupted_nef_win.zip">fix_corrupted_nef_win.zip</a>", then move the
   "fix_corrupted_nef.exe" application onto your hard disk.</li>

<li class=spc><b>Drag and drop the corrupted NEF files</b> and/or folders onto
   the "fix_corrupted_nef.exe" application.</li>

<li class=spc>A command window should open and prompt with this message:<br><br>

   "Bit depth of compressed images (12 or 14) [14]?"<br><br>
   
   <b>Type either "12" or "14", then press RETURN</b>.  If you don't know the
   bit depth of your compressed NEF images, or if you have mixed 12
   and 14-bit compressed images, or if you have only uncompressed NEF
   images, just type "14" (or simply press RETURN).  If this is wrong
   for some images, you will not be able to open the fixed images
   (but you can delete these and re-generate them with the other bit
   depth later).  Note that this number is ignored for the D3200 and
   D5200 since the NEF bit depth can not be changed for these cameras.</li>

<li class=spc>The application should now run and create a <b>"fixed" folder</b> beside
   each of the original NEF images.  This folder contains the fixed
   NEF images with the same names as the originals.</li>

<li class=spc><b>Verify that you can open the fixed NEF images</b>.  If you can't open
   any of the images, delete them and go back to step 2, but this time
   select the other bit depth in step 3.  (Only the images you deleted
   will be re-generated, the others won't be touched.)</li>
</ol>

<p>With any luck, the mess caused by the Nikon software is now fixed, and
all of your <b>NEF images are now restored!</b></p>

<p>If you are feeling so happy that you absolutely must send me a
donation, this can be done from <a href="https://exiftool.org/index.html#donate">the ExifTool home page</a>.</p>

<li><b>Download and expand</b> "<a href="https://exiftool.org/fix_corrupted_nef.zip">fix_corrupted_nef.zip</a>" into a directory on
your hard disk.</li>

<li class=spc><b>Open a Terminal window</b>.
   (on Mac, launch /Applications/Utilities/Terminal)</li>

<li class=spc><b>Drag and drop "fix_corrupted_nef.pl"</b> onto the Terminal window.
   (Note: The distributed "lib" folder must exist in the same folder
   as the "fix_corrupted_nef.pl" application.  If you moved
   "fix_corrupted_nef.pl" to a different folder you must also move its
   "lib" folder to the same place before running.)</li>

<li class=spc><b>Drag and drop the corrupted NEF files</b> and/or folders onto
   the Terminal window.</li>

<li class=spc>Select the Terminal window, then <b>press RETURN</b> on the keyboard.</li>

<li class=spc>You should see this prompt:<br><br>

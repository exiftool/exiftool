See html/index.html for more details about ExifTool features.

ExifTool can be downloaded from

  http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

RUNNING

The exiftool script can be run right away without the need to install
Image::ExifTool.  For example, from within the exiftool directory you can
extract the information from one of the included test files by typing:

  ./exiftool t/images/ExifTool.jpg

If you move the exiftool script to a different directory, you must also
either move the contents of the lib directory or install the Image::ExifTool
package so the script can find the necessary libraries.

Note:  If you are using the Windows cmd shell, you may need to rename
'exiftool' to 'exiftool.pl' to run it directly from the command line.
Alternatively, you can run exiftool with the command 'perl exiftool'.

IF YOU ARE STILL CONFUSED

The exiftool script is a command line application.  You run it by typing
commands in a terminal window.  The first step is to determine the name of
the directory where you downloaded the ExifTool distribution package.
Assuming, for example, you downloaded it to a folder called "Desktop" in
your home directory, then you would type the following commands in a
terminal window to extract and run ExifTool:

  cd ~/Desktop
  gzip -dc Image-ExifTool-11.03.tar.gz | tar -xf -
  cd Image-ExifTool-11.03
  ./exiftool t/images/ExifTool.jpg

Note:  These commands extract meta information from one of the test images. 
To use one of your images instead, enter the full path name of your file in
place of "t/images/ExifTool.jpg".

INSTALLATION

You can install the Image::ExifTool package to make it available for use by
other Perl scripts by typing the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Notes:
  i) You need root access for the last step above.

  ii) Some Perl installations (like the standard OSX installation) may not
  contain the necessary files to complete the first step above.  But no
  worries:  You can install ExifTool manually by moving 'exiftool' and the
  'lib' directory to any directory in your current PATH (ie. /usr/bin).

  iii) In Windows, "dmake" or "nmake" may be used if "make" is not
  available.

(Also see html/install.html for more help with installation.)

DEPENDENCIES

Requires Perl version 5.004 or later.  No other special libraries are
required, however the following modules are recommended for decoding
compressed and/or encrypted information from the indicated file types, and
for calculating digest values and providing other features listed below:

  Archive::Zip         (ZIP, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODP, ODS, ODT, EIP, iWork)
  Compress::Zlib       (DNG, PNG, PDF, DCM, MIE and SWF files)
  Digest::MD5          (PDF files, IPTC information, and JPG Extended XMP)
  Digest::SHA          (PDF with AES-256 encryption)
  IO::Compress::Bzip2  (RWZ files)
  Time::HiRes          (for generating ProcessingTime tag)
  POSIX::strptime      (for inverse date/time conversion)
  Time::Piece          (alternative to POSIX::strptime)
  Unicode::LineBreak   (for column alignment of alternate-language output)
  Win32::API           (for proper handling of Windows file times)
  Win32::FindFile      (for Windows Unicode directory support, app only)
  Win32API::File       (for Windows Unicode file names and file times)
  IO::Compress::RawDeflate   (for writing FLIF images)
  IO::Uncompress::RawInflate (for reading FLIF images)

  perldoc Image::ExifTool::TagNames

  man exiftool
  man Image::ExifTool
